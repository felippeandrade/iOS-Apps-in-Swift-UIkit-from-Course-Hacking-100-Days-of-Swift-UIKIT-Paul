# Project 18 Challenges 1 and 2

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/18/6/wrap-up

For the sake of completion as additions to Project 1 are limited.

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/18/6/wrap-up):
>1. Temporarily try adding an exception breakpoint to project 1, then changing the call to instantiateViewController() so that it uses the storyboard identifier “Bad” – this will fail, but your exception breakpoint should catch it.
>2. In project 1, add a call to assert() in the viewDidLoad() method of DetailViewController.swift, checking that selectedImage always has a value.
